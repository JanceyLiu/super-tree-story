My name is Jancey, and this is my story.

There once was a kangaroo named Joey.  He hopped and boxed everyday and worried. He was afraid of all of the spiders and snakes in the outback.

But he likes to eat candy! He likes to go to a candy store in the town called
"JanceyLikeYou". The boss of the candy store is Jancey, a cute girl.

Joey bought a candy bar from Jancey and went to show his friends. They all wanted candy too. All the kangaroos lived happily
ever after and never had to worry about neither the spiders nor the snakes.
